# Stimulus without Webpack

This is a small minimal working Example (mostly for myself) to test end-to-end how to build a website which makes use of stimulus controllers with no webpack (and thus no buildpack at all!).
All of the Credits go to the basecamp / hey.com / ruby on rails team as they did all the work.
I just assembled the information from various sources and tried to make a really minimal example.

To run the demo just start the index.html in some kind of webserver (if you start it directly from filesystem loading of relative javascripts may not work).
